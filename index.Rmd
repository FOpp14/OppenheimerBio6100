#### What is this website for? My homework assignments!

<br/>

Making a [github repo](https://github.com/FOpp14/ComputationalBiology) was Homework 1

This is the link for [Homework 2](Homework_02.html)

Looking for [Homework 3](Homework_03.html)?

[Homework 4](Homework_04.html) was fairly challenging

We did [Homework 5](Homework_05.html) on Valentine's day - boy do I LOVE R!

[Homework 6](Homework_06.html) used data from the real world - check out [the study I took mine from!](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30464066/)
