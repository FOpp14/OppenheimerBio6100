##### Creating a fake dataset using Mean Unique Units per Cycle

```{r}

# purposefully NOT making this a function because I want these variables to be accessible later

library(ggplot2) # for graphics
library(MASS) # for maximum likelihood estimation
library(dplyr)
  
# Read in data
z <- read.csv("Allen et al - Proceedings B Supplementary Data - Raw Data 3.csv",header=TRUE,sep=",")
z$myVar <-z$Mean.Unique.Units.per.Cycle
summary(z)

# Generate relevant summary statistics from data
normPars <- fitdistr(z$myVar,"normal")
print(normPars) # mean is 20.038462 , sd is 1.014290
str(normPars)
zMean <- normPars$estimate["mean"] # note structure of getting a named attribute -> mean is 20.61364 (as stated above)
zSD <- normPars$estimate["sd"] 
# Using data from Allen et al., 2018 - mean unique units per cycle

# Generate random normal data with the mean and sd from that dataset
counts <- rnorm(n=3,mean=zMean,sd=zSD)
years <- c("2002","2003","2004")

# make that normal data into a data frame
normz <- data.frame(years,counts)
print(normz)

```

##### Conducting an ANOVA with Mean Unique Units per Cycle

```{r}

# setting up one-way ANOVA - just the first 3 years

# Global Variables

nGroup <-  3
nName <- c("2002","2003","2004") # names of groups
nSize <- c(12,12,12) # number of observations in each group

# For loop for getting summary stats of my new dataset

ID <- 1:(sum(nSize)) # ID vector for each row (sum of the number of observations) - the overall number of rows we need!


ANOVA <- function() {
  
  # summary stat for loop
  
  for (i in 1:3) {
  
    year <- normz[i,"years"]
    mean <- normz[i,2] # already a mean in the dataset given, no need to calculate it
  
  # I am getting NA for SD because there's really only one value which IS the mean, so I'm just going to assign random values
    sd <- runif(1) 
    
  # use the summary stats to make a normal distribution
  resVar <- c(rnorm(n=nSize[1],mean=mean,sd=sd))
  
  }

# doing the ANOVA

TGroup <- rep(nName,nSize) # repeating the name by the number
ANOdata <- data.frame(ID,TGroup,resVar) #
print(ANOdata)
str(ANOdata)
print(ANOdata)

# make graph

ANOPlot <- ggplot(data=ANOdata,aes(x=TGroup,y=resVar,fill=TGroup)) +
  geom_boxplot()

print(ANOPlot)
}

ANOVA
```

##### Making a Bar Plot (and calculating the median to build it)

```{r}

library(ggplot2)

BarPlot <- function() {
  
  for (i in 1:3) {
  
    year <- normz[i,"years"]
    mean <- normz[i,2] # already a mean in the dataset given, no need to calculate it
    median <- normPars$estimate["median"] 
  
  # I am getting NA for SD because there's really only one value which IS the mean, so I'm just going to assign random values
    sd <- runif(1) 
  }
    
  # use the summary stats to make a bar chart

ggplot(df,aes(x=Category))+geom_boxplot(aes(lower=mean-sd,upper=mean+sd,middle=mean,ymin=mean-3*sd,ymax=mean+3*sd),stat="identity")
  
}

```
